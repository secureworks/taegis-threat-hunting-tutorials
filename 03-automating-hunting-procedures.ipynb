    "# Tutorial 3: Automating Hunting Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bootstrap threat hunting procedure notebook from template\n",
    "- Populate new procedure notebook with canned language and desired search queries\n",
    "- Enumerate available hunting procedures\n",
    "- Launch an instance of the new hunting procedure\n",

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to create a well-formed threat hunting procedure notebook using a provided template.\n",
    "A threat hunting procedure is a Jupyter notebook intended to be re-used and shared with other analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Read Procedure Template\n",
    "\n",
    "> Before we begin, please ensure that the notebook kernel is set to `taegis-hunting-tutorials`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike notebooks used for free-form exploratory data analysis, a threat hunting procedure should contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notebook metadata to help organize the procedure in a catalog of hunting procedures kept under version control.\n",
    "- Markdown content to describe the threat and the methodology used to find evidence of the threat. This will be used to populate the key findings section of a Taegis investigation.\n",
    "- Code content to import useful dependencies and create a Taegis investigation from the notebook.\n",
    "- Taegis queries to fetch relevant data in alerts and/or events.\n",
    "- Analysis logic, usually in the form of filtering and transforming `pandas` DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find it easier to create a new hunting procedure from a template.\n",
    "The procedure author only needs to fill in the details specific to the new procedure, rather than worry about the other elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provided a minimal procedure notebook template in `templates/procedure-template.ipynb`.\n",
    "This template is a skeleton that we will fill in to make our new hunting procedure. We will call our new hunting procedure \"My First Hunting Procedure\"."
